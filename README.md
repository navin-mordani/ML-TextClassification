# Linear and Non-Linear Classification of Text by Subject

## Introduction

The project evaluates the performance of linear and nonlinear classifiers in the categorization of abstracts from technical papers.
The dataset used is of 88639 abstracts, each classified as coming from one of 4 different subjects: mathematics, computer science, physics, and
statistics. 

## Details

First execute the feature_extraction post which each of the classifiers can be run. Some of the files have been coded in ipython notebook
and a few in the traditional python format. This project was part of a Kaggle Competition.
